# Projects
## gradeGenerator

A programme that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then outputs the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

## speedDetector

A program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

## Salary Calculator
